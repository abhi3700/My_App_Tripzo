* **Trending posts** - Initially, couldn't figure out the way to bring the ```getTrendingPosts```. 
      Then, searched multiple repositories (for 6 hrs). None of them worked!!...
      Then, raised an issue on **SteemJ** Github [here](https://github.com/marvin-we/steem-java-api-wrapper/issues/220).
      
* **ChromeCustomTab** - in-app browser was added here.

* **Market Tab** - began creating it. SwipeRefreshListener, textviews, etc.
